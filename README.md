# Angel Baby Products

Please visit my site [Angel](https://baby-products-3fff4.web.app/).

"Angel" is a baby products service which offers different products for babies.I made this site with react,react-router,mui, react-hook-form,bootstrap,mongodb as backend etc. I used firebase for hosting live site and Heroku for live server. 

* I used express,dotenv,cors etc for make my server workable at mongodb 
* Here,GET method is used if any data in database to be used in the client side.
* POST method is used if data is to be stored in mongodb database. I used severel times to post different data and they were saved at different collection in database
* PUT method is used to update any data that proviously saved in mongodb. I updated data in userCollection in my database.
* DELETE method can delete any data from collection.I used delete method in userCollection to delete any users and productCollection to delete any product by admin
