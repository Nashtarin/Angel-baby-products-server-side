# Angel Baby Products

Please visit my site [Angel](https://baby-products-3fff4.web.app/).

"Angel" is a baby products service which offers different products for babies.I made this site with react,react-router,mui, react-hook-form,bootstrap,mongodb as backend etc. I used firebase for hosting live site and Heroku for live server. 

* The website consists of main three routes at first, Home, About Us, Explore
* A user can login using email/password but he/she has to register, when a user at first click to the login button at the top right of the site, it will redirect it to login page, when the user logged in then a dashboard button will come at the header. 
* When user is not admin he/she will see three routes My order,Review and pay in dashboard page and also a logout button can be shown at the top.
* If the user is admin he/she will see more four routes they are Manage All Orders, Add A Product, Make Admin and Manage All products.However,these route are protected,only admin can go there.                           
* At home page there are six different sections,header,footer,products,upcoming toys and user reviews with dynamic ratings.
* At home page each product has a button named Purchase,when user click this it will go to the  Purchase page. However, the purchase page is private/protected route, user must login to go there while he/she clicking the Purchase button in home page.Moreover, when the user logged in then user will be redirected automatically to that page where he/she were. In addition,in this private route if reloaded it will not go to the login page
* Clicking explore button at the header user will see all the products
* In Purchase page, at the left side it shows the detail information of the product and at the right side there is a form for a user to fill up. However, name,email,price are already written when the user logged in. User only have to fill certain fields. When the user click Buy button,a browser alert comes and says order placed successfully.
* In Manage All Orders route user admin can see all the orders that have been placed by all users, whereas in My Orders shows the orders only made by that user
* The Add a offer page the user admin can add a product by giving certain information and clicking Add a product,the product will be added to the home page.
